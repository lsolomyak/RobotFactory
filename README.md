## Project Organization

The code for this project is divided across four branches:

    analysis (current branch)       <- all of the data and analysis code
    study01-jspsych                 <- software for Experiment 1
    study02-jspsych                 <- software for Experiment 2

The organization of the main branch (current branch) is as follows:

    ├── figures                     <- Figures for presentations & manuscript.
    ├── manuscript                  <- LaTeX code for the manuscript.
    ├── study01                     <- Data and code for Experiment 1.
    ├── study02                     <- Data and code for Experiment 2.
