# Similarity

This folder contains perceptual similarity judgments for three alphabets, the English alphabet and the Brussels artificial character sets (BACS). The similarity judgments are used to construct pseudo-random orderings of robot "runes" that maximize the percetual dissimilarity of successive characters. 

The perceptual similarity ratings of English characters were taken from the supplement of [Simpson et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-012-0271-4). The download link is [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-012-0271-4#SecESM1). Note: only the standard 26 characters were retained. Characters with diacritics were removed. 

The perceptual similarity ratings of the Brussels artificial character sets were taken from the supplement of [Vidal et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0844-8). The download link is [here](https://osf.io/gpb8c/).
